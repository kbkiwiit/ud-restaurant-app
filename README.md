# Udacity Project - FEND Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1
---

## Project Overview

I was tasked with taking a static design that lacks accessibility and converting the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. There was also a requirement to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to following to run this project:

1. An up to date web browser (Google Chrome Canary was used for development).
2. Some way of replicating a webserver. This project uses Python, but other alternatives like Live Server in VSCode could work too. Just update the port in the **dbhelper.js** file.
3. Your own mapbox API key.

### Viewing the Project

To open the project in your browser do the following.

1. Ensure you have the correct port entered in the **dbhelper.js** file.
2. Ensure you have added your MapBox API key into the **main.js** and **restaurant_info.js** files (look for the comments).
3. Open the index page in your browser by going to http://localhost:8000.index.html. **Replace the port with your one if different**.
